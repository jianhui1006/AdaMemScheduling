# AdaMemScheduling
Generalizable and Scalable Memory-Aware Scheduling: the Power of Adaptivity Methods

To be updated code ...

## Code

Note that some parameters should be modified befor using. Input/output path is always needed.

**scheduler.cpp**

Including algorithms LIST, POST, DFSM, BFSM, GAG, IIA.

**dm-tree.cpp**

**dm-sca.cpp**

**dp.cpp**

State compression dynamic programming. Use to calculate the optimal solution on small graphs. Related to Exp-1.

### Usage
Step 1: Modify the parameters in the code, including input/output path, threshold and so on.

Step 2: Compile and run.
```
g++ code.cpp -o code -std=c++17 -O2
./code
```
